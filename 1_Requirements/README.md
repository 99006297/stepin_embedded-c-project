INTRODUCTION
-----------------
In this project we are discussing about heating system in vehicles.Vehicle passenger comfort is both a commercial and a health issue. By the passing time, human needs are changing due to the life style that is experienced and past luxuries become necessities.Thermal comfort management of vehicle cabins can be regarded as one of these changing needs. It is highly important for companies and consumers to have a reliable thermal comfort system in their vehicles. However comfort sense is subjective and changes from passenger to passenger.This opens a new field of study alongside of the work for developing tools for thermal management. The new field is machine learning and control for taking or reducing the responsibility of passenger to arrange the proper conditions for thermal comfort in a vehicle cabin. Nevertheless, developing tools for thermal comfort and assessment of those tools are still very important since their outcomes will be used for modelling and controlling comfort conditions.

FEATURES
-----------
1.These tells us the person is there or not.
2.If person is sat on the seat it will give signal.
3.If it shows the siganl it will determine temp.
4.They can have the access to modify the temperature in vehicle using prob.
5.Person can set the temperature by looking into display.

SWOT Analysis
--------------
STRENGTH
-------------
* It is user friendly.
* we can change temperature easily.
* low cost.
* Can be instlled easily.

WEAKNESS
----------
* Its is applicable for countries which having low temperature.

OPPORTUNITES
------------
* It can be implemented by replacing heater by AC.So that we can use in other countries.

THREATS
------------
* Not sutiable for high temperature places.
