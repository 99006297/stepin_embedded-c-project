INTRODUCTION
-------------
In this project we are discussing about heating system in vehicles.Vehicle passenger comfort is both a commercial and a health issue. By the passing time, human needs are changing due to the life style that is experienced and past luxuries become necessities.Thermal comfort management of vehicle cabins can be regarded as one of these changing needs. It is highly important for companies and consumers to have a reliable thermal comfort system in their vehicles. However comfort sense is subjective and changes from passenger to passenger.This opens a new field of study alongside of the work for developing tools for thermal management. The new field is machine learning and control for taking or reducing the responsibility of passenger to arrange the proper conditions for thermal comfort in a vehicle cabin. Nevertheless, developing tools for thermal comfort and assessment of those tools are still very important since their outcomes will be used for modelling and controlling comfort conditions.

1:Button Sensor will check the passenger is seated or not.

2:Temperature sensor works as table no. 1

3:Display CDD-CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM.

4:Led Actuator shows the driver is seated

5:Heater will check the heater button is ON

6:Temp to CAN shows the value of temperature gone over protoco.
